		<p class="text2">You should be able to communicate directly and effectively when it comes to your guests. But if your customer service requires endless games of phone tag or lost email chains, you can make getting simple answers very complicated. <span style="font-weight: 900;"> Are you ready to connect with your customers the way they want to communicate - <span style="color:#44C4E7;">the same way they communicate with their friends?</span></span></p>

					<p>Managing customer messages on your personal number can be a hassle. The volume of messages you receive is almost unmanageable alone. But with Captivated, you can forward conversations to other employees that can help. You can also leave important notes on customers so nothing gets lost in translation. Your entire team will be able to tackle customer communications on one platform and you avoid the need to carbon copy people to death on personal texts. You're taking potential obstacles out of our personal phone and making conversations move faster instead. Plus, you don't have to worry that when employees leave your business they'll take customer contacts with them.</p>
