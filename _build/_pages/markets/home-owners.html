    <p class="text1" style="font-weight: 900;">Business texting made easy <br><span style="color:#44C4E7; font-weight: bold;">for HOME SERVICE COMPANIES</span></p>
    <p class="text2">When homeowners need your help, they should be able to easily reach you. But the service industry faces endless games of phone tag and lost email chains when it comes to connecting with customers. That can turn simple conversations into a big headache. <span style="color:#000; font-weight: bold;">Instead, connect with your potential customers in the way they want to communicate - <span style="color:#44C4E7; font-weight: bold;">the same way they communicate with their friends.</span></span></p>

      <h2 class="space2" style="text-align:center;">Homeowners expect to text</h2>

      <p class="space4" style="text-align:center;">Customers are going to expect to be able to text their repair needs whether you're prepared to handle it or not. Your customers want answers quickly and conveniently. Using texting will make your business more efficient.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pro_col2_right" style="background:#3A4150;">
      <h2 class="space2" style="text-align:center;">Stop using your personal number</h2>
      <p class="space4" style="text-align:center;">Managing customer messages on your personal number is impossible. The volume of messages alone is tough to handle, not to mention the inability to leave notes on customers and forward conversations to other employees. By empowering your entire team to tackle customer communications on one platform, you avoid the need to carbon copy people to death on personal texts. You're taking potential obstacles out of our personal phone and making conversations move faster instead. Also, by centralizing communications on your employee platform, you don't have to worry that employees might walk away with your customers if they leave your business.</p>
