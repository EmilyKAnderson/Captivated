		<p class="section2-text2">Imagine letting your patients text the same phone number that they are currently calling. When the text comes in it can be handled like a silent phone call. You can quickly respond, you can transfer it to the right person in your office to respond, or you can even schedule a reminder text to go outbound later. You can make it happen. By adding texting to your patient support efforts, you'll make your practice better, more effective and keep your patients happy.</p>
