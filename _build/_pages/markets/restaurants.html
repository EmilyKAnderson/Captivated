    <p class="text1">Texting made easy <span style="font-weight: 800;">for restaurants</span></p>
    <p class="text2">Your guests just want to easily make dinner reservations or ask a simple question. They don't want to play phone tag or waste time on hold.  When they want answers, guests should be able to reach you quickly. Transform your hosting stand with your restaurant guests the way they want to communicate instead. Best of all, <span style="font-family:Assistant-Bold">cut down on the inbound phone traffic</span> <span style="font-weight: 800; color:#44C4E7">by allowing your patrons to text</span> your phone line instead of call you.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Why do you need to call just<br> to get a reservation?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Managing a restaurant is hard. Your host stand can get overwhelmed with incoming calls with reservation requests, pickup or waiting times while you are trying to help guests in front of you. Do you want your staff to juggle all these issues or handle communication more effectively? If you're not texting, you're not offering customers a way to get answers faster. Using texting makes your business more efficient. </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Don't stress over personal numbers</h2>
        <p>You can't make your staff use personal numbers to make texting work in the restaurant. With Captivated, you can use a company text line to make your communication system work. If your hosting staff gets overwhelmed, they can forward conversations to other employees to help get reservations and orders scheduled. Empower your staff to tackle incoming and outgoing messages all on one platform.</p>
