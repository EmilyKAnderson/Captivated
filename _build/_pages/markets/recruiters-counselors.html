			<h1 class="text4">Group messaging</h1>
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#fff;"> Managing your admissions department is hard.</span> Throughout the recruiting year, the wave of communications from prospective students can be overwhelming. Conversations get lost. Students wait too long for responses, while other universities follow up on time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#fff;"> With group messaging </span>coming in early 2017, you can manage all of your department's communications more easily and deliver faster response times to student inquiries. Department leaders can assign any admissions counselor or university recruiter messages and direct communication to the right person. You never have to worry if messages sent to students on time. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#fff;"> Increase efficiency from employees and more interest from students.</span> They simply receive and return texts to you, so your team can guide them through the recruiting process.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#fff;"> Access Captivated anywhere - </span>With the Captivated mobile app, your university can manage student and recruiter communication on-the-go. Our app can be used on any Desktop, iOS or Android device.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#fff;"> Make every prospective student a success story.</span> No two students are alike. Some prospective students contemplate their college decision early in high school. Others will put it off until the final year. With Captivated, you can keep in touch with students along their journey-from freshmen to seniors-every step of the way. Answer questions via text when they request admissions materials, schedule campus visits, fill out applications and deliver the final commitment-so you can tailor the right message to help them through the process.
