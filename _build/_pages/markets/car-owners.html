The perfect non-solicitation starter text is simply sharing your digital business card with a customer saying, &#8220;Hi Mr. Jones, for your convenience, here is my contact card.  Please feel free to reach out anytime in the future or reply 'stop' if you would prefer not to communicate via text.&#8221; </p>
