Your privacy matters to Captivated, LLC. Our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Use of the Captivated services or any other service or product offered or sold by Captivated is subject to this Privacy Policy..

####Collection and Use of Personal Information

Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you use a Captivated service or are in contact with Captivated or a Captivated affiliated company. Captivated LLC and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.

####Information we collect

We collect information to provide better services to our users and customers. We collect information in two ways, information you provide to us and information we collect from the use of our services. Information you provide to us may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, physical address, telephone number(s). Note, we use PCI compliant third parties for our Credit Card Billing and E-Check (ACH) processing and DO NOT STORE such data on Captivated servers.

We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you actually use our service, visit our website, your login history, device information, and messaging responsiveness.
We may also collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). This device information may be associated with you and/or your physical address.
When you use our services or view content provided by us, we may automatically collect and store certain information. This may include (i) details of how you used our service, (ii) average response times (iii) your Internet protocol address, (iv) device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL, and (v) cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, your device, or you.


####Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information

We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
  - We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website andfrom our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

####Accessing and updating your personal information
If the personal information we store about you is incorrect, we endeavor to provide you with ways to correct it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. However, the use of some of our services require the provision of certain personal information and the failure to provide such information in an accurate and timely manner may make the provision of our services impossible.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing service offering), risks the privacy of others, would be impractical, or prohibitively expensive.
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

####Cookies and Other Technologies

Any of the Captivated website technologies, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

Captivated and its partners may use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Captivated and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, services, and applications.

####Disclosure to Third Parties

Captivated may make certain personal information available to technology partners that work with us to provide products and services or handle the billing and processing of your payments. Personal information will only be shared by Captivated to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties solely for their marketing purposes.

####Service Providers

Captivated may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
Captivated may also share personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Captivated operates.

####Others

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.

####Protection of Personal Information

Captivated takes precautions - including administrative, technical, and physical measures- to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. You are solely responsible for the safekeeping of your login credentials including username and passwords.

####Children

Captivated does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

####Third-Party Sites and Services

Captivated websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. These sites are not covered by our Privacy Policy and you should independently review the privacy practices of those third parties.
