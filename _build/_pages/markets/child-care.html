			   <p>Captivated helps you communicate with parents in every part of the enrollment process. Whether they are just starting an application ready to enroll, Captivated provides the fastest, most convenient way to communicate. This is especially important between the time a child is accepted into your program and when they actually enroll. Once you know a family is serious about your program and meets all the requirements, use texting to keep them updated on important dates and tasks they still need to complete. By offering quicker communication, you are giving your preschool or day care a competitive advantage and staying top-of-mind. </p>
